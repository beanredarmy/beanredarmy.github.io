My name is Dau Hong Quan. Translating myname word-by-word into English means Bean Red Army :v. I was born in 1996, at Dien Chau, Nghe An province, Viet Nam. Now I am a student of Hanoi University of Science and Technology. I am keen on Linux Embedded and hope you guys will find something useful in my blog.
